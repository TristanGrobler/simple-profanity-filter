# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** December 19, 2025

---

## TL;DR

**Simple Profanity Filter does not collect, store, transmit, or share any personal data. Everything happens locally in your browser.**

---

## 1. Introduction

Simple Profanity Filter ("the Extension") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how the Extension handles data and your information.

## 2. Data Collection

### What We DON'T Collect:

- Personal information (name, email, address, etc.)
- Browsing history or website visits
- Video content or captions you watch
- Usage statistics or analytics
- Cookies or tracking identifiers
- IP addresses or device information

### What We DO Store (Locally Only):

- **Trigger Words List:** Your custom list of words to filter
- **Extension Settings:** Your preferences (e.g., hide captions toggle)

**Important:** All data is stored locally using Chrome's storage API (`chrome.storage.sync`). This means your settings sync across your devices through your Google account's Chrome Sync feature, but are never sent to our servers (because we don't have any servers).

## 3. How the Extension Works

The Extension operates entirely within your browser:

- Monitors closed caption text on video streaming websites
- Compares caption text against your local trigger words list
- Mutes/unmutes video audio based on matches
- All processing happens on your device in real-time

## 4. Permissions Explanation

### Host Permissions (https://*/* and http://*/*):

The Extension requests access to all websites to enable caption monitoring on streaming platforms (Netflix, YouTube, DSTV Now, and others). This permission allows the Extension to:

- Read caption/subtitle elements from video players
- Control video mute state
- Apply caption visibility styles

**Note:** Despite having broad permissions, the Extension does not access or collect any data from websites you visit.

### Storage Permission:

Used to save your trigger words list and preferences locally in your browser.

### ActiveTab Permission:

Allows the Extension to interact with the current tab to control video playback.

## 5. Third-Party Services

The Extension does not use any third-party services, analytics tools, or external APIs. There are no connections to external servers whatsoever.

## 6. Data Sharing

We do not share, sell, rent, or trade any user data because we don't collect any user data. Your trigger words and settings remain private and are never transmitted outside your browser (except through Chrome Sync if you have that enabled in your Google account).

## 7. Children's Privacy

The Extension does not knowingly collect any information from children or any users. It is safe for use by individuals of all ages.

## 8. Data Security

Since all data is stored locally using Chrome's built-in storage API, security is handled by your browser. We recommend:

- Keeping your browser updated
- Using a strong password for your Google account (if using Chrome Sync)
- Being cautious about sharing your device with others

## 9. Your Rights and Control

You have complete control over your data:

- **View Data:** Open the Extension popup to see your trigger words and settings
- **Export Data:** Use the "Copy All" button to export your word list
- **Delete Data:** Remove individual words or uninstall the Extension to delete all data
- **Modify Settings:** Change your preferences anytime through the popup interface

## 10. Changes to Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this page with an updated "Last Updated" date. Continued use of the Extension after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.

## 11. Open Source

The Extension's code may be reviewed to verify these privacy claims. We believe in transparency and encourage technical users to inspect the code.

## 12. Contact Information

If you have questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy or the Extension's privacy practices, please contact us through the Chrome Web Store support page.

## 13. Compliance

This Extension complies with:

- Chrome Web Store Developer Program Policies
- General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) principles
- California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) where applicable

**Legal Basis (GDPR):** No personal data is processed, so no legal basis is required.
